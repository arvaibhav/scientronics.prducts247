KUGGÖ / LINDÖJA,"Parasol, beige",300.00,192.674.62,beige,Outdoor,Parasols & gazebos,"<h1>Product information</h1>
<div> 
 <div>
  The fabric gives excellent protection against the sun’s UV rays as it has a UPF (Ultraviolet Protection Factor) rating of 50+, which means it blocks 98% of the ultraviolet radiation.
 </div> 
 <div>
  It’s easy to open and close the parasol by pulling the handle up or down. The parasol automatically locks in open position.
 </div> 
 <div>
  You are protected from the sunshine all day long, since the parasol can be tilted.
 </div> 
 <div>
  With a light, passing rain shower, you can stay and relax under the parasol since the canopy repels water.
 </div> 
 <div>
  The colour stays fresh for longer as the fabric is fade resistant.
 </div> 
 <div>
  The parasol pole is made of aluminium which means it won’t rust.
 </div> 
 <div>
  It’s easy to keep the canopy clean and fresh since you can easily remove and machine wash it.
 </div> 
 <div>
  The air vent reduces wind pressure and allows heat to circulate.
