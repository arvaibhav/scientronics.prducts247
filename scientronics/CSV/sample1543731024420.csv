<div> 
 <div>
  A classic continental bed with a soft headboard, fully upholstered – perfect for placing in the middle of the room. And in case of accidents, the cover can be removed and machine washed.
 </div> 
 <div>
  Latex and wool filling in the mattress pad, with high pressure relieving capacity, enables you to relax more fully and gives a softer sleep surface.
 </div> 
 <div>
  A soft layer of mini pocket springs, on the top layer of the mattress, contours to the natural curves of the body to create an enhanced comfort.
 </div> 
 <div>
  Individually wrapped pocket springs, in the mattress core, work independently and closely follow your body; giving you support in all the right places.
 </div> 
 <div>
  A generous layer of soft fillings adds support and comfort.
 </div> 
 <div>
  The mattress base has a core of Bonnell springs that dampen your movements, reducing pressure on your body and allowing air to circulate – so that your body and mattress will feel good for a long time.

<div> 
 <div>
  A classic continental bed with a soft headboard, fully upholstered – perfect for placing in the middle of the room. And in case of accidents, the cover can be removed and machine washed.
 </div> 
 <div>
  Latex and wool filling in the mattress pad, with high pressure relieving capacity, enables you to relax more fully and gives a softer sleep surface.
 </div> 
 <div>
  A soft layer of mini pocket springs, on the top layer of the mattress, contours to the natural curves of the body to create an enhanced comfort.
 </div> 
 <div>
  Individually wrapped pocket springs, in the mattress core, work independently and closely follow your body; giving you support in all the right places.
 </div> 
 <div>
  A generous layer of soft fillings adds support and comfort.
 </div> 
 <div>
  The mattress base has a core of Bonnell springs that dampen your movements, reducing pressure on your body and allowing air to circulate – so that your body and mattress will feel good for a long time.

<div> 
 <div>
  The fabric gives excellent protection against the sun’s UV rays as it has a UPF (Ultraviolet Protection Factor) rating of 50+, which means it blocks 98% of the ultraviolet radiation.
 </div> 
 <div>
  It’s easy to open and close the parasol by pulling the handle up or down. The parasol automatically locks in open position.
 </div> 
 <div>
  You are protected from the sunshine all day long, since the parasol can be tilted.
 </div> 
 <div>
  With a light, passing rain shower, you can stay and relax under the parasol since the canopy repels water.
 </div> 
 <div>
  The colour stays fresh for longer as the fabric is fade resistant.
 </div> 
 <div>
  The parasol pole is made of aluminium which means it won’t rust.
 </div> 
 <div>
  It’s easy to keep the canopy clean and fresh since you can easily remove and machine wash it.
 </div> 
 <div>
  The air vent reduces wind pressure and allows heat to circulate.
 </div> 
 <div>
  The strap with buckle keeps the fabric in place when folded.

 <br>Complete with LINDÖJA parasol canopy so that you have a spare canopy when you want to change the look of the parasol or when the parasol canopy needs to be washed.
 <br>The parasol does not provide protection against reflected or scattered solar ultraviolet radiation.

KUGGÖ / LINDÖJA,"Parasol with base, beige, Grytö dark grey",425.00,292.676.16,beige/Grytö dark grey,Outdoor,Parasols & gazebos,"<h1>Product information</h1>
<div> 
 <div>
  The fabric gives excellent protection against the sun’s UV rays as it has a UPF (Ultraviolet Protection Factor) rating of 50+, which means it blocks 98% of the ultraviolet radiation.
 </div> 
 <div>
  It’s easy to open and close the parasol by pulling the handle up or down. The parasol automatically locks in open position.
 </div> 
 <div>
  You are protected from the sunshine all day long, since the parasol can be tilted.
 </div> 
 <div>
  With a light, passing rain shower, you can stay and relax under the parasol since the canopy repels water.
 </div> 
 <div>
  The colour stays fresh for longer as the fabric is fade resistant.
 </div> 
 <div>
  The parasol pole is made of aluminium which means it won’t rust.
 </div> 
 <div>
  It’s easy to keep the canopy clean and fresh since you can easily remove and machine wash it.
 </div> 
 <div>
  The air vent reduces wind pressure and allows heat to circulate.
 </div> 
 <div>
  The strap with buckle keeps the fabric in place when folded.
 </div> 
</div>
<h3>Good to Know</h3>
<div>
  The parasol base must be completely filled with sand.
 <br>Approximately 25 litres of sand is needed (approx. 35 kg).
 <br>Complete with LINDÖJA parasol canopy so that you have a spare canopy when you want to change the look of the parasol or when the parasol canopy needs to be washed.
 <br>May be completed with TOSTERÖ parasol cover (160 cm).
 <br>Always fold the parasol when not in use and never use it when it is windy.
 <br>The parasol does not provide protection against reflected or scattered solar ultraviolet radiation.
 <br>
</div>
<h3>care instructions</h3>
<div>
 Parasol base
 <br>Wipe clean with a soft cloth dampened in water and a mild washing-up detergent or soap, if necessary.
 <br>At the end of the season, empty out the sand, clean the parasol base and store it in a cool, dry place.

<div> 
 <div>
  Of course your home should be a safe place for the entire family. That’s why a safety fitting is included so that you can attach the chest of drawers to the wall.

  Integrated damper catches the running drawer and closes it slowly, silently and softly.
 </div> 
 <div>
  The concealed drawer runners ensure that drawers run smoothly even when heavily loaded.

  Adjustable feet make it possible to compensate any irregularities in the floor.

STOCKHOLM 2017,"Three-seat sofa, Sandbacka dark grey","6,995.00",203.445.01,Sandbacka dark blue,Living room,All sofas,"<h1>Product information</h1>
<div> 
 <div>
  SANDBACKA cover is made of velvet which, through a traditional weaving technique, gives the fabric a warm, deep colour and a soft surface with a dense pile and light, reflective shine.
 </div> 
 <div>
  Velvet is a soft, luxurious fabric that is resistant to abrasion and easy to clean using the soft brush attachment on your vacuum.
 </div> 
 <div>
  The seat and back cushions provide comfortable support for your body and easily regain their shape because they’re filled with high resilience foam and polyester fibres.
 </div> 
 <div>
  You can turn the back cushions so they wear evenly and last longer, as they’re reversible and have the same fabric on both sides.
 </div> 
 <div>
  The felt pads underneath protect the surface below against scratches.

  By combining different seating sections you can create a sofa in a shape and size that perfectly suits your outdoor space.

  The cushion has a longer life, since it can be turned over and used on both sides.
 </div> 
 <div>
  The cover is easy to keep clean and fresh, as you can take it off and machinewash it.
 </div> 
 <div>
  You can make your sofa even more comfortable and add a personal touch by complementing with decorative cushions in different sizes and colours.
